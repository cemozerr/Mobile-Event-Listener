TODO:
1) Start with just building a js script using web3 that uses a hard coded abi and contract address that watches for event changes
2) Add a python-flask-database to store the results of event changes
3) Have an api post call from js script whenever it notices an event change, that sends all the event result to database
4) Make the js script dynamic so that you can input any abi, contract address, and event you would like
5) Put the js script inside a native script application so that you can enter all the info from your phone and get notified when js script notices an event change
